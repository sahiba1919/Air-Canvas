# Air-Canvas
The project is an "Air Canvas" application built using Python and several libraries, including OpenCV and Media pipe. The purpose of the application is to allow users to draw on a virtual canvas by moving their fingers in the air in front of a webcam.
The application uses the Mediapipe library to detect and track the user's hand movements in real-time using a webcam.

Canvas Interface: It provides a virtual canvas displayed on the screen where users can draw using their hand movements.

Color Selection: Users can choose different colors for drawing by selecting from color buttons displayed on the canvas interface.

Drawing Functionality: Users can draw lines on the canvas by moving their fingers in the air. The application detects the movements of the user's fingertips and draws lines accordingly on the canvas.

Clearing Canvas: There's an option to clear the canvas to start drawing afresh.
